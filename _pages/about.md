<span style="font-size: 90%;">I'm currently a predoctoral researcher (IRiSS Predoctoral Research Fellowship Program) in the [Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org/) and Stanfordâ€™s Department of Political Science. My work focuses on assisting with research related to the [GeoMatch](https://immigrationlab.org/geomatch/) tool, a matching algorithm that helps refugees, asylum seekers, and other immigrants find the locations where they are most likely to thrive.</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%;">Graduated with Bachelor's degrees in Statistics and Psychology (additional major in Decision Science) from Carnegie Mellon University, where my research interests have broadly included social identity, stereotype threat, and designing psychologically wise interventions in education.</span>
