Currently a Predoctoral Researcher (IRiSS Predoctoral Research Fellowship Program) in the Immigration Policy Lab and Stanfordâ€™s Department of Political Science. My work focuses on assisting with research related to the GeoMatch tool, a matching algorithm that helps refugees, asylum seekers, and other immigrants find the locations where they are most likely to thrive. 

Graduated with Bachelor's degrees in Statistics and Psychology from Carnegie Mellon University, where my research interests have broadly included social identity, stereotype threat, and designing psychologically wise interventions in education. 

Previously, I've conducted research in sports analytics and worked as a data scientist for the Pittsburgh Pirates.
