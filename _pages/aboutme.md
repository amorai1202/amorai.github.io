A little more about me: 
- I usually tell people I’m from the West Coast; I spent my childhood in Vancouver, BC (yes, I’m a proud Canadian), moved around the Bay Area during my adolescence, and lived in Seattle during the pandemic. 
- I am a former competitive basketball player (looks can be deceiving) turned insufferable Gen Z runner. I’ve dabbled with bouldering and Crossfit and have worked in the sports industry (think Moneyball). 
- Things I won’t shut up about: anything sports-related, my sneaker collection, Survivor, my sneaker collection, coffee
