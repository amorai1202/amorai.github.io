# Abstract

Positive stereotypes, such as model minority stereotypes, can impact important academic outcomes for Asian American students. Building on prior research on implicit vs explicit forms of stereotype activation, this study examines whether and how much performance mindsets (i.e., motivation to succeed or avoid failure) affects task performance in a stereotyped domain for Asian American students, i.e., math ability. In a 1x3 between-subjects study, stereotype activation (implicit, explicit, none) was manipulated prior to performing a spatial rotation task that participants believed measured their math ability. We found no evidence that the manner of stereotype activation led to differences in task accuracy, nor did scores on an Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ-R) predict task performance or mediate the effects of our manipulation. However, pre- and post-task measures revealed a significantly lower endorsement of performance-approach goals and diminished levels of racial centrality after the manipulation and task, compared to the participantsâ€™ baseline. We also examined other factors relevant to stereotype threat in exploratory analyses that highlight avenues for future research in this area.
